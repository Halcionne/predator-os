Established in 2021 by Hossein Seilany, it is a polymorphic security platform for pen-testing and ethical hacking. It is also hardened, secure, anonymous, and privacy-focused.

Predator Linux is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  Mini, kernel 5.10 LTS, and using a fully customized xfce4 lightweight desktop with a special menu of tools.Predator Linux has around 1300 pre-installed tools which are split into 30 several categories.
Predator Tools are imported from both Debian and Ubuntu repositories and GitHub page. Most kernel and user configs are customized by default to prevent any hacking, non-privileged access and reduce the attack surface.
many built-in firewalls and defensive tools allow end-users to control the Predator-OS. Predator also supports much privacy, anonymized, security tools, and also both it to be run as Live-CD or from a USB Drive and installation mode.

Hopefully, This OS can be beneficial for all normal and more refined users.

# Improving performance and tuned kernel and user levels:
1) In order to improve the performance of the CPU frequency range has been changed intel_pstate to acpi-cpufreq by default.
2) The BIOS frequency limitation has been disabled by default in order to improve the performance of the CPU frequency range, 
3) In order to improve the performance of the hard disk and boot time, the watchdog has been disabled by default.
4) Improving the performance of the hard disk by changing the I/O scheduler for SATA, HDD, and NVMe disks.
5) Improved CPU performance by changing the default kernel scheduler to a Linux-zen kernel.
6) Improving network and Internet performance by changing the Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR).
7) Improved RAM memory function by changing the randomize_va_space status.
8) Improved virtual memory performance by replacing zswap instead of swap by default.
9) The hardware threads (physical CPU) for each CPU core have been enabled.
10) Improving the paralleling of tasks by allowing independent tasks (running threads) by sharing some processor resources.
11) Changed power saving mode to performance mode by default, In order to improve the performance of the disk and network IO.
12) All CPU governor frequency has switched in performance.
13) Reducing kernel log-level reports to a low level in order to improve kernel performance and increase security and create silent boot mode.
14) and also, improving TCP performance, increasing inode cache memory, disk cache, improving network and bandwidth parameters, etc.
